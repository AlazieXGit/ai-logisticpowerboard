### 1. Python Application Workflow (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`)
- Triggers on push and pull requests to the `main` branch
- Sets up Python 3.10
- Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt` (if present)
- Runs linting with flake8
- Runs tests with pytest
- **Note**: Currently, there are no Python files in the repository, so this workflow is prepared for future Python components

### 2. Deploy LoadBoard AI Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Handles deployment automation (see script for details)

    # Black additional input arguments.
    additional_args: # optional, default is 
    # Exit code when black formatting errors are found [true, false]. Defaults to 'true'.

    fail_on_error: # optional, default is true
    # Main branch of the repository to speed up incremental diff

    main_branch: # optional, default is main
    # (--quiet) Don't emit non-error messages to stderr. Errors are still emitted; silence 
  those with 2>/dev/null

    quiet_mode: # optional, default is false
    # (--diff) Don't write the files back, just output a diff for each file on stdout.

    print_diff_mode: # optional, default is false
    # (--check) Don't write the files back, just return the status. Return code 0 means nothing 
  would change. Return code 1 means some files would be reformatted. Return code 123 means
  there was an internal error.

    check_mode: # optional, default is false
    # Turn on if you only want to check changed files instead of all files.

    only_changed_files: # optional, default is false
    # Sha of the commit to compare files to.
