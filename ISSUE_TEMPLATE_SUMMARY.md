# Issue Template Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the issue templates and contributing guidelines added to help structure issues and contributions better.

## What Was Added

### Issue Templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)

We've created structured templates to help contributors submit detailed, actionable issues:

1. **Bug Report** (`bug_report.yml`)
   - For reporting bugs and errors
   - Includes: description, steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, environment details
   - Helps developers quickly understand and fix issues

2. **Feature Request** (`feature_request.yml`)
   - For suggesting new features or enhancements
   - Includes: problem statement, proposed solution, benefits, priority level
   - Helps prioritize and plan new features

3. **Documentation** (`documentation.yml`)
   - For reporting documentation issues or improvements
   - Includes: documentation type, issue description, location, suggested improvements
   - Helps keep documentation accurate and helpful

4. **Security Vulnerability** (`security.yml`)
   - For reporting security issues
   - Includes: severity level, vulnerability type, impact, recommended fix
   - Includes reminders about private disclosure for critical issues

5. **General Issue** (`general.yml`)
   - For issues that don't fit other categories
   - Includes: issue type, description, related components, acceptance criteria
   - Flexible template for various types of contributions

6. **Config** (`config.yml`)
   - Configures issue creation experience
   - Disables blank issues (forces use of templates)
   - Provides links to discussions, documentation, and security reporting
