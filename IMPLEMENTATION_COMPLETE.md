# Implementation Complete: Issue Templates and Contributing Guidelines

## Summary

The draft issue has been addressed by implementing a comprehensive issue management system with templates, guidelines, and documentation to help future contributors provide clear, detailed information when creating issues.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Issue Templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)

Five structured templates for different types of issues:

- **🐛 Bug Report** - For reporting bugs with reproduction steps
- **✨ Feature Request** - For suggesting new features with clear benefits
- **📚 Documentation** - For documentation improvements
- **🔒 Security** - For security vulnerabilities (with private disclosure reminders)
- **📋 General** - For other types of issues (questions, tasks, improvements)

### 2. Template Configuration

- **Config File** - Disables blank issues, encourages use of templates
- **Contact Links** - Provides quick access to Discussions, Documentation, and Security reporting

### 3. Pull Request Template

Structured PR template ensuring:
- Clear description of changes
- Type of change identification
- Testing checklist
- Security considerations
- Deployment notes

### 4. Contributing Guide (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)

Comprehensive 200+ line guide covering:
- Development environment setup
- How to report issues and submit changes
- Code style guidelines (JS/TS, Python, CSS)
- Testing requirements
- Security best practices
- Project structure overview
- PR review process

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Updated `README.md` with links to templates and contributing guide
- Added support section with links to issue templates
- Added contributing section

### 6. Testing Infrastructure

- Created `test_templates.py` with 4 tests validating:
  - YAML syntax of all templates
  - Required fields presence
  - File existence
  - Documentation updates

- Created `pyproject.toml` for pytest configuration

### 7. Summary Documentation

- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed explanation of all templates and their usage
