# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices and policies for the LoadBoard AI application.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainers directly with details
3. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables

- **NEVER** commit `.env` files containing sensitive data to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
- Store sensitive credentials in:
  - GitHub Secrets for CI/CD workflows
  - Secure environment variable management systems for production
  - Local `.env` files (gitignored) for development

### Credentials and Secrets

- **DO NOT** hardcode credentials, API keys, or secrets in source code
- Use environment variables accessed via `import.meta.env.VITE_*` for frontend
- Use process.env for backend/Node.js code
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use unique credentials for each environment (dev, staging, production)

### API Keys and Tokens

The following should be stored as environment variables:
- `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL` - Admin email address
- `VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin password (hashed)
- `VITE_BACKUP_EMAIL` - Backup admin email
- `VITE_BACKUP_PASSWORD` - Backup password (hashed)
- `VITE_MASTER_KEY` - System master key
- `VITE_SYSTEM_ID` - System identifier
- `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` - Supabase API key
- `VITE_STRIPE_KEY` - Stripe API key
- `VITE_TWILIO_KEY` - Twilio API key
- `VITE_OPENAI_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- `VITE_DB_URL_PROD` - Production database URL
- `VITE_DB_URL_STAGING` - Staging database URL

### GitHub Actions Security

#### Secrets Management
- Store all deployment credentials in GitHub Secrets:
  - `RENDER_SERVICE_ID`
  - `RENDER_API_KEY`
  - `RAILWAY_TOKEN`

#### Workflow Artifacts
- **DO NOT** upload artifacts containing:
  - Environment files (`.env*`)
  - Credentials or keys
  - Database dumps with real data
  - Compiled bytecode that may contain hardcoded values
  - Cache directories that may contain sensitive data

#### Build Artifacts
- Review all artifact uploads to ensure no sensitive data is included
- Use `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` to exclude sensitive files
- Minimize artifact retention periods

### Git History

If sensitive data was previously committed:
1. Use `git rm --cached` to remove from tracking
2. Update `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
3. Consider using tools like `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner to remove from history
4. Rotate any exposed credentials immediately

### Code Review Checklist

Before merging code, verify:
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] Environment variables used for all sensitive configuration
- [ ] `.env` files not committed
- [ ] No database credentials in code
- [ ] No private keys or certificates in repository
- [ ] Workflow artifacts don't expose sensitive data
- [ ] Secrets properly stored in GitHub Secrets

### Docker Security

- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude:
  - `.env*` files
  - `.git` directory
  - Credentials and keys
  - Development dependencies

### Dependencies

- Regularly run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies to patch security issues
- Review dependency licenses and security advisories

## Incident Response

If credentials are exposed:
1. **Immediately** rotate all affected credentials
2. Review access logs for unauthorized access
3. Assess impact and data exposure
4. Update affected systems with new credentials
5. Document the incident and response

## Compliance

- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Use secure communication (HTTPS/TLS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Security Updates

This document should be reviewed and updated:
- Quarterly as part of security review
- When new security requirements are identified
- After security incidents
- When adding new integrations or services
